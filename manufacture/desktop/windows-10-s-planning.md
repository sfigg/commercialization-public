# Planning a Windows 10 in S mode deployment

Building a Windows 10 in S mode or Windows 10 S image is like building an image for any other desktop edition of Windows, with some key differences. You can add apps, drivers, and customizations to Windows 10 in S mode, but you'll have to make sure they're supported.

## Executables

When planning a deployment, make sure you understand what runs, and what is blocked in Windows 10 in S mode. Choose and test customizations that work with Windows 10 in S mode and won't interrupt your deployment. If you need to run unsigned code, you can [enable the manufacturing mode registry key](windows-10-s-manufacturing-mode.md) which allows you to run unsigned code, but once the PC ships the unsigned code will be blocked.

### What runs on Windows 10 in S mode?

Only run executable code that is signed with a **Windows**, **WHQL**, **ELAM**, or **Store** certificate from the [Windows Hardware Developer Center Dashboard](https://aka.ms/DevCenterPortal). This includes companion apps for drivers.

Apps not signed with one of the certificates mentioned, including companion apps, are blocked. When a blocked app is run, the user is notified that the app cannot run.

### What is blocked in Windows 10 in S mode?

The following components are blocked from running in Windows 10 in S mode. Any script or application that calls one of these blocked components will be blocked. If your manufacturing process uses scripts or applications that rely on blocked components, you can temporarily [enable manufacturing mode](windows-10-s-manufacturing-mode.md#enable-manufacturing-mode-1) for configuring and testing, but you can't ship a PC with manufacturing mode enabled.

- bash.exe
- cdb.exe
- cmd.exe
- cscript.exe
- csi.exe
- dnx.exe
- fsi.exe
- hh.exe
- infdefaultinstall.exe
- kd.exe
- lxssmanager.exe
- msbuild.exe
- mshta.exe
- ntsd.exe
- powershell.exe
- powershell_ise.exe

- regini.exe
- syskey.exe
- wbemtest.exe
- windbg.exe
- wmic.exe
- wscript.exe
- wsl.exe

### Microsoft Office

For the best customer and end-user experience, preinstall Microsoft Office using the Office 16.5 OPK. This version of Microsoft Office is the same version that's available in the Microsoft Store, and runs on Windows 10 in S mode. We show you how to enable S mode and install the Office 16.5 OPK in the [OEM deployment of Windows 10](oem-deployment-of-windows-10-for-desktop-editions.md) lab.

### Testing your app

For information on how to test your app, see [Test your Windows app for Windows 10 in S mode](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/uwp/porting/desktop-to-uwp-test-windows-s).

## Drivers

For Windows 10 in S mode driver guidelines and requirements, see [Windows 10 in S mode Driver Requirements](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/windows-hardware/drivers/install/Windows10SDriverRequirements).

## Customizations

Not all customizations are supported in Windows 10 in S mode. This section shows which customizations are supported, which customizations are not supported, and how to enable manufacturing mode that allows you to perform customizations in audit mode.

### Supported customizations

The following table shows customizations in Windows 10 in S mode, the mechanism to deploy the customizations, and the environment where you can deploy the customizations.

> Bing is set as the search default and Microsoft Edge is set as the default browser in Windows 10 in S mode.  These settings can’t be changed.

### Enable customizations in audit mode

To enable customizations in audit mode, you have to enable manufacturing mode by adding a registry key to your offline image. Manufacturing mode allows you to run unsigned code that is normally blocked. For instructions on how to add or remove the manufacturing registry key, see [Manufacturing registry key](windows-10-s-manufacturing-mode.md).

You'll also have to configure ScanState to exclude the registry key when capturing your recovery package. This ensures that the registry key doesn't get restored during reset or recovery scenarios. We'll cover how to exclude the key from recovery in the [Windows 10 in S mode deployment lab](windows-10-s-deployment-sxs.md)

> [!IMPORTANT]
> Don't ship your Windows 10 in S mode PC with the registry in place. You'll have to remove the registry key prior to shipping the device.

| Windows 10 Education in S mode to Windows 10 Education |

> [!Note]
> Starting with Windows 10, version 1803, switching from S mode doesn't require a reboot.

## Recovery

### Built-in recovery

Windows 10 S includes a recovery solution that enables a user to restore, refresh, or troubleshoot their PC. Recovery in Windows 10 S has some differences from other editions of Windows. These differences are:

- Third party recovery solutions are NOT supported
- Extensibility points for customizations documented in this section is supported
    - OEM tools in WinRE is not supported
    - CMD prompt in WinRE will be enabled but only allow execution of inbox WinRE binaries
    - Extensibility script must be in the form of a *.CMD
    - Does not call any of the blocked inbox components except reg.exe and wmic.exe

### Recovery scenarios for S mode

> **Note:** This applies to Windows 10 in S mode (Windows 10, version 1803 and later).

This table shows what Windows edition and mode will result from a user performs a system recovery:

| Preinstalled OS | Was Windows switched to non-S mode? | Was Windows upgraded to a different edition?            | PCs mode/edition at recovery           | PBR (both “keep my files” and “Remove Everything”)      | BMR using OEM factory recovery image    | BMR using User-created media |
| ---------- | -------------------- | ----------------------------------- | -----------------           | ------------- | ------ | ---------------------- |

> - BMR: Bare metal recovery
> - PBR: Push button reset


### Validating recovery in your deployment

After you configure your Windows 10 S PC for recovery scenarios, validate that it is working properly by verifying that these scenarios run successfully:

- Run refresh recovery and validate the user files are preserved and your factory desktop customizations are restored.
- Run reset recovery and validate the user files and profile are removed and your factory desktop customizations are restored.
- Validate extensibility scripts in the simulated RS3 enforcement level using the provided policy file.
- If you created a recovery package with ScanState, ensure that the manufacturing key was excluded from capture.

## Retail Demo eXperience (RDX)

Microsoft will provide updated content for RDX that will need to be deployed during Manufacturing. This updated content includes new content packages with Windows 10 Pro in S mode (Windows 10 S) specific marketing messages for Windows and Office. 

The Updated RDX supersedes previously released RDX included in the RS2 Features on Demand.  The updated RDX which includes Windows 10 Pro in S mode (Windows 10 S) specific content can be used on all SKUs. The RDX will detect the Windows edition to display the corresponding RDX content.
