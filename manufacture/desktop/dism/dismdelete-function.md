\[Some information relates to pre-released product which may be substantially modified before it's commercially released. Microsoft makes no warranties, express or implied, with respect to the information provided here.\]

Releases resources held by a structure or an array of structures returned by other [DISM API Functions](dism-api-functions.md).

Syntax
---

```
HRESULT WINAPI DismDelete(
  _In_ VOID *DismStructure
);
```

Parameters
-------

*DismStructure* \[in\]  
A pointer to the structure, or array of structures, to be deleted. The structure must have been returned by an earlier call to a [DISM API function](dism-api-functions.md).

Return value
---------

Returns `S_OK` on success.

## <span id="Remarks"></span><span id="remarks"></span><span id="REMARKS"></span>Remarks


All structures that are returned by DISM API functions are allocated on the heap. The client must not delete or free these structures directly. Instead, the client should call **DismDelete** and pass in the pointer that was returned by the earlier DISM API call.
