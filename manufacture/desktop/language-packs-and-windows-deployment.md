# Languages

Set up Windows 10 or Windows Server with the right set of languages, settings, and keyboards or other input devices for customers in different regions.

## Localize Windows

* [Add languages to Windows](add-language-packs-to-windows.md): Add localized text for the dialog boxes, menu items, and help files that you see in Windows, and more **Microsoft-Windows-Client-Language-Pack_x64_es-es.cab**. 

  - [List of available languages for Windows](available-language-packs-for-windows.md).

  - [List of available language and region Features on Demand](features-on-demand-language-fod.md): Add localized fonts, text-to-speech, optical character recognition (OCR), speech recognition, and handwriting recognition.

* [Add languages to your recovery environment](customize-windows-re.md) so users can troubleshoot and recover their devices using their preferred language.
  - WinRE language packs are distributed on the language pack ISO. Don't use the WinPE language packs that ship with the ADK.

* Localize the Windows [Out of Box Experience (OOBE)](how-oobexml-works.md).

## Localize the installation process

* [Add languages to Windows Setup](add-multilingual-support-to-windows-setup.md) to create Windows installation media that works in the user's preferred language and shows the languages available in the Windows image.

* [Add languages to a Windows Distribution](add-multilingual-support-to-a-windows-distribution.md) to help users on a corporate network select Windows in their preferred language

Please note that not all components and Features on Demand are available for every language. You can learn which FODs are available for languages [in the LP to FOD mapping spreadsheet](http://download.microsoft.com/download/0/A/A/0AA4342D-3933-4216-A90D-3BA8392FB1D1/Windows%2010%201703%20FOD%20to%20LP%20Mapping%20Table.xlsx)

To learn more about adding language components to Windows, see [Add and remove languages](add-and-remove-language-packs-offline-using-dism.md).


## <span id="get_language_packs_and_lips"></span>Where to get language components

[Available Languages for Windows](available-language-packs-for-windows.md) lists all of the supported language packs for multiple versions of Windows, as well as their identifier codes.

-   **OEMs and System Builders** with Microsoft Software License Terms can download the language pack ISO and Feature on demand ISO from the [Microsoft OEM site](http://go.microsoft.com/fwlink/?LinkId=131359) or the [OEM Partner Center](http://go.microsoft.com/fwlink/?LinkId=131358).
-   **IT Professionals** can download language packs from the [Microsoft Volume Licensing Site](http://go.microsoft.com/fwlink/?LinkId=125893).
-   After Windows is installed, **end users** can download and install additional language packs in **Settings** > **Time & language** > **Language** > **Add a language**, or through the Microsoft Store app. 

### Where to get other language components

-   Language features on demand are distributed on the FOD ISO as .cab files, but can also be installed on running Windows installation with DISM using the `/add-package` option. See [Features on Demand](features-on-demand-v2--capabilities.md) for information on how to add these to an image.
-   WinRE language packs are distributed on the language pack ISO. Don't use the WinPE language packs that ship with the ADK.


## Considerations when adding languages

-   Some languages require more hard-disk space than others.
-   Although you can add many language packs at once, don't add too many at once because the device may not have enough memory to handle it. General recommendations: from Windows in audit mode, don't add more than 20 language packs at a time. From Windows PE, don't add more than 7. If WinPE is still running out of memory, you can [customize WinPE by adding temporary storage (scratch space)](winpe-mount-and-customize.md).
-   The default language cannot be removed because it is used to generate computer security identifiers (SIDs). The default UI language is the language that is selected during the Out-Of-Box-Experience (OOBE), the UI language specified in the Deployment Image Servicing and Management (DISM) command-line tool, or in the unattended answer file if you skip OOBE.
-	If you install an update (hotfix, general distribution release [GDR], or service pack [SP]) that contains language-dependent resources prior to installing a language pack, the language-specific changes in the update won't be applied when you add the language pack. You need to reinstall the update to apply language-specific changes. To avoid reinstalling updates, install language packs before installing updates.


### <span id="Language_packs_for_recovery_tools"></span><span id="language_packs_for_recovery_tools"></span><span id="LANGUAGE_PACKS_FOR_RECOVERY_TOOLS"></span>Language packs for recovery tools

When things go wrong, the Windows Recovery Environment (Windows RE) can help recover the system and data. When you update the available languages for Windows, update the available languages in the recovery tools: [Customize Windows RE](customize-windows-re.md).

## <span id="Languages_for_apps"></span><span id="languages_for_apps"></span><span id="LANGUAGES_FOR_APPS"></span>Languages for apps


Many apps include support for multiple languages, though some require separate installation of language packs to work properly. Consult with the app developer.

In general, install all of your languages onto Windows before installing apps. This helps make sure that the language resource files are available for each of the available apps.

For more information, see [Multilingual User Interface (Windows)](http://go.microsoft.com/fwlink/p/?LinkId=698642).

## Where is lp.cab?

Language packs were renamed in Windows 10 version 1607:

| Package | Name format | Example |
|---------|-------------|---------|
| Language pack | Microsoft-Windows-_SKU_-Language-Pack_\_arch_\__locale_.cab | Microsoft-Windows-Client-Language-Pack_x64_es-es.cab |

**Note:** This change doesn't apply to WinPE, where language packs still use the name lp.cab.

## Where are the LIP .appx files?

You can find the LXP .appx files and their associated license files in the LocalExperiencePack folder on the Language Pack ISO.
