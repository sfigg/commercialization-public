# Windows 10 IoT Core Commercialization FAQ

If you're looking to get a few questions answered regarding the commercialization process, you've come to the right place. Not finding your question? Submit a suggested question below under "Feedback". 

**Has Windows 10 IoT replaced embedded?**

Windows 10 IoT is the replacement for the Windows Embedded product lines. 

**How do you support Windows 10 IoT Core? Do you have Long-Term Servicing Branch (LTSB) and Long-Term Servicing Channel (LTSC) support for 10 years, similarly to Windows 10 IoT Enterprise?**

Yes, we recently announced LTSC for Windows 10 IoT Core and Enterprise. You can read more about this announcement [here](https://blogs.windows.com/business/2018/02/27/microsoft-doubles-down-on-windows-10-iot-with-added-support/#MmJYmvwyK7y8YADs.97).

**What is the difference between LTSC and Semi-Annual Channel (SAC) for Windows 10 IoT Core?**

Both LTSC and SAC are mandatory for commercialization. LTSC is part of [Windows 10 IoT Core Services](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/windows-hardware/manufacture/iot/iotcoreservicesoverview), which provides 10 years of support, update control, and Device Health Attestation (DHA). LTSC has a small fee per device. While SAC is free, it requires signing a SAC agreement every six months and none of the essential services that LTSC offers.  

**If I go the SAC route, what will happen six months after I’ve signed the agreement?**

You will need to come back and sign the agreement again. If you’d prefer not to manage this, you can sign an agreement with a distributor, where the agreement renews differently and automatically. You can learn more about distributors [here](http://wincom.blob.core.windows.net/documents/Windows_IoT_Distributor_Information.pdf).

**Do my devices have to update automatically?**

There is not a requirement that a device be connected to the internet. The license does require that you provide a mechanism to provide an update to the device if needed, but there are non-internet connected methods of delivering updates. You can learn more [here](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/windows-hardware/service/iot/managing-iot-device-update).

**How can I use Cortana for my Windows 10 IoT Core device?**

You can leverage the Cortana Devices SDK, which can be found [here](https://developer.microsoft.com/en-us/cortana/devices).

**Do I have to use a specific version of Visual Studio when developing with Windows 10 IoT Core?**

No, you can use any version of Visual Studio you’d like. 

**Where can I get extra in-person help for prototyping and commercializing?**

Microsoft’s IoT & AI Insider Labs are facilities to help you develop, prototype and test IoT and AI solutions for market commercialization. Located in Redmond, USA; Munich, Germany; and Shenzhen, China; they are located at the heart of Microsoft’s product group, industrial and manufacturing solutions. You can learn more about these labs [here](https://www.microsoftiotinsiderlabs.com/).
