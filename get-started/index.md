# Get started with Windows 10

Build innovative and differentiated devices with Windows 10. Windows 10 runs on a broad set of devices—from desktops, notebooks, phones, and Internet of Things (IoT) devices. The operating system's common core works across platforms with 80-inch screens, 4-inch screens, or devices with no screens at all.

You can create devices to use touch/pen, mouse/keyboard, controller/gesture—or you can build them to switch between input types.

> See [Kits and tools overview](kits-and-tools-overview.md) to learn how our kits and tools enable you to work with Windows.

## Design hardware with the latest features

Building a great Windows 10 device starts with selecting the right components. Understanding the difference between minimum and optimal hardware requirements will ensure the best usability and performance. Our guidelines explain the requirements to implement Windows features like Cortana, Windows Hello, Touch, Windows Pen, and Continuum.

* [Hardware component guidelines](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/windows-hardware/design/component-guidelines/components)

## Customize Windows images to reflect your brand

For desktop PCs, you can use your existing settings file (Unattend.xml) to add settings during Windows installation.

* [Build a Windows Setup unattend file](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/windows-hardware/manufacture/desktop/update-windows-settings-and-scripts-create-your-own-answer-file-sxs)

## Develop Universal Windows Drivers

Learn fundamental concepts about drivers.

* [Concepts for all driver developers](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/windows-hardware/drivers/gettingstarted/concepts-and-knowledge-for-all-driver-developers)

Create a single driver that runs across multiple device types, from embedded systems to tablets and desktop PCs. UMDF and KMDF templates are included in Visual Studio to help you get started.
