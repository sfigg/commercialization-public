# Windows Hardware Compatibility Program Certification Process

The Windows Hardware Compatibility Program lets you show customers that your hardware is reliably compatible with Windows 10. The program contains tools and processes that determine whether your hardware meets Windows 10 quality standards.

## Step 1: Review Hardware Requirements
Building a great Windows device starts with understanding the hardware requirements.
- [Minimum hardware requirements for Windows 10](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/windows-hardware/design/minimum/minimum-hardware-requirements-overview)
- [Windows Hardware Compatibility Program specifications](whcp-specifications-policies.md)

## Step 2: Register on Hardware Dashboard
Before you start testing for Windows compatibility, you should register with the hardware dashboard. Later, you’ll use the dashboard to submit your hardware for the Hardware Compatibility Program.
- [About the Windows Hardware Dev Center dashboard](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/windows-hardware/drivers/dashboard/)
- [Register for the Hardware Program](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/windows-hardware/drivers/dashboard/register-for-the-hardware-program)

## Step 3: Install the Windows Hardware Lab Kit
Get ready to test your Windows hardware by installing the Windows Hardware Lab Kit (HLK) and configuring your test environment. The tests that are included in the Windows HLK help you validate compatibility with Windows 10 and get your hardware listed on the certified product list. The HLK Getting Started Guide provides instructions on how to build a test environment, automate driver and system testing, and create the submission package required to participate in the Windows Hardware Compatibility Program.

- [Windows HLK Getting Started](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/windows-hardware/test/hlk/getstarted/windows-hlk-getting-started)
- [Download the HLK](https://developer.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/hardware/windows-hardware-lab-kit)

## Step 4: Submit Results
After testing your hardware and packaging the results with the HLK, you can submit the results to the hardware dashboard to qualify for the Windows Hardware Compatibility Program. 
- [Create a New Hardware Submission](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/windows-hardware/drivers/dashboard/create-a-new-hardware-submission)
- [Manage Hardware Submissions](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/windows-hardware/drivers/dashboard/manage-your-hardware-submissions)

## Step 5: Manage and Update
After you submit your test results, you can monitor and manage your submission in the dashboard.

- [Manage driver distribution with shipping labels](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/windows-hardware/drivers/dashboard/manage-driver-distribution-by-submission)
- [Manage device metadata experiences](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/windows-hardware/drivers/dashboard/manage-device-metadata-experiences)


## Troubleshooting
The dashboard also provides additional services, including:
- [Driver Failure Reporting](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/windows-hardware/drivers/dashboard/driver-failure-reporting)
- [Bug Management](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/windows-hardware/drivers/dashboard/bug-management)

The [Windows Hardware Lab Kit User's Guide](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/windows-hardware/test/hlk/user/windows-hardware-lab-kit-user-s-guide) also provides the following guidance on interpreting test failures and bug submission:
- [Troubleshooting Windows HLK Test Failures](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/windows-hardware/test/hlk/user/troubleshooting-windows-hlk-test-failures)
- [Windows HLK Support](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/windows-hardware/test/hlk/user/windows-hlk-support)
