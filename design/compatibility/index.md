# Windows Hardware Compatibility Program

The Windows Hardware Compatibility Program is designed to help your company deliver systems, software and hardware products that are compatible with Windows and run reliably on Windows 10 and Windows Server 2016. The program also provides guidance for developing, testing and distributing drivers. Using the [Windows Hardware Dev Center dashboard](https://developer.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/hardware/dashboard-sign-in), you can manage submissions, track the performance of your device or app, review telemetry and much more.

## Windows Hardware Lab Kit

The Windows Hardware Compatibility Program leverages the tests in the [Windows Hardware Lab Kit](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/windows-hardware/test/hlk/windows-hardware-lab-kit), a test framework used to test hardware devices for Windows 10.

## Playlists

The Windows Hardware Compatibility Program uses an official playlist to determine which devices meet the requirements for compatibility with Windows 10. All playlists that we have published are acceptable to use for submissions to the Windows Hardware Dev Center.

The latest playlist can be downloaded at: [http://aka.ms/HLKPlaylist](http://aka.ms/HLKPlaylist)
