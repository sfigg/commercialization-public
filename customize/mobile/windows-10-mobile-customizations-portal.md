Customizations for Windows 10 Mobile allow you to run mobile line-of-business applications on a platform that ensures that data is captured securely and efficiently.

See [Prepare for Windows mobile development](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/windows-hardware/manufacture/mobile/preparing-for-windows-mobile-development) for guidance.
