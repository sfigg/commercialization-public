                                      on their SIM (basic SIM, USIM, or RUIM)."  
                         Owner=""  
                         OwnerType="OEM"> 
      
      <Static>  

        <Settings Path="People/SIMContactManagement">  
          <Setting Name="EnableSIMAddressBookAndExport" Value="" /> 
       </Settings>  

      </Static>

    </ImageCustomizations>
    ```

1. Set the value of `EnableSIMAddressBookAndExport` to one of the following values:

    <table>
    <colgroup>
    <col width="50%" />
    <col width="50%" />
    </colgroup>
    <thead>
    <tr class="header">
    <th>Value</th>
    <th>Description</th>
    </tr>
    </thead>
    <tbody>
    <tr class="odd">
    <td><p>0 or 'False'</p></td>
    <td><p>Disables the <strong>export contacts to SIM</strong>/<strong>import SIM contacts</strong> button in the <strong>People</strong> settings screen.</p></td>
    </tr>
    <tr class="even">
    <td><p>1 or 'True'</p></td>
    <td><p>Enables the <strong>export contacts to SIM</strong>/<strong>import SIM contacts</strong> button in the <strong>People</strong> settings screen.</p></td>
    </tr>
    </tbody>
    </table>

## Testing

1. Flash the build containing this customization to a device with a SIM.
1. Go to the **People** Hub and tap the **+** button to add a new contact.
1. Verify that you can see the **Create contact in** window, which includes an option for creating the contact in the **SIM**.
1. Choose where you would like to create the contact, and then add a new contact by filling in a name and phone number.
1. Go to the People **Settings** screen.
1. Verify that you can see both an **export contacts to SIM** button and an **import SIM contacts** button.
   * The **import SIM contacts** button will not be activated unless the SIM you used for testing already contains SIM contacts or the contact you created in step 4 was created in the SIM.
   * The **export contacts to SIM** button will not be activated unless there are contacts in your Microsoft account.
