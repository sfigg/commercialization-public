| Topic                                 | Description                                                                                   |
|:--------------------------------------|:----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| [Disable text correction and suggestions](disabling-text-correction-and-suggestions.md)  | For markets that do not use any of the available input languages, partners pick an alternative available input language as the default, but disable text prediction, auto-correction, and the spelling checker by default, using this customization. |
| [Hardware keyboard character repeats hold time and delay](hardware-keyboard-character-repeats-hold-time-and-delay.md)     | For devices that have a hardware keyboard, partners can optionally set the character repeat hold time and delay.   |
| [On-screen keyboard delay](on-screen-keyboard-delay.md)   | When an external keyboard (e.g. Bluetooth keyboard or barcode scanner which connects as an HID keyboard) is used with a device, the on-screen keyboard is hidden. When the screen is touched, there is a hard-coded delay of 60s before the on-screen keyboard reappears. With this customization, an OEM can define the delay value before the on-screen keyboard reappears.    |
| [Pre-enabled keyboard](pre-enabled-keyboard.md)     | OEMs can use this customization to pre-enable additional device keyboards.    |
| [Text correction and suggestions](text-correction-and-suggestions.md) | Partners must enable text correction and text suggestions for at least one input language, and can optionally include more.    |
