|:--------------------------------------|:----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| [Authentication for Wi-Fi hotspot settings](authentication-for-wi-fi-hotspot-settings.md) | Set a list of captive portal SSIDs for which the browser should not be launched automatically for Wi-Fi authentication.                                |
| [Cellular data fallback when in limited Wi-Fi connectivity](cellular-data-fallback-when-in-limited-wi-fi-connectivity.md)    | OEMs can change the default behavior for the device when Wi-Fi connectivity becomes limited.                         |
| [Change Wi-Fi to WLAN](change-wi-fi-to-wlan.md)                               | To meet regulatory requirements and/or meet mobile operator requirements for some markets, partners can replace the string Wi-Fi with the generic term WLAN. Enabling this customization changes all Wi-Fi strings to WLAN.  |
| [Connecting to open Wi-Fi hotspots in Windows 10](wi-fi-hotspots.md)          | Partners can change the default settings for detecting and auto-connecting to Wi-Fi hotspots.                                                                       |
| [Enable static IP](enable-static-ip.md)                                       | To facilitate Wi-Fi certification tests, OEMs can enable a screen from the Wi-Fi settings screen that provides UI elements that allow you to specify a static IP address, gateway address, and DNS server address.    |
| [Limited connectivity status](limited-connectivity-status.md)                 | By default, when the device is connected to a Wi-Fi access point (AP), it does not show a No Internet access status message below the AP name. Partners may choose to override this default behavior and show the status message when a device is connected to a Wi-Fi access point.                                                        |
| [Wi-Fi always on, always connected](wi-fi-always-on-always-connected.md)      | Partners can modify AOAC behavior and UX for non-AOAC mode devices.   |

| [Wi-Fi calling operator name](wi-fi-calling-operator-name.md)                 | OEMs can customize the display name for the mobile operator when the device is using Wi-Fi calling.                                                                  |
| [Wi-Fi icon and notifications](wi-fi-icon-and-notifications.md)               | Partners can configure settings related to the Wi-Fi icon.    |
