| [Additional alarms](additional-alarms.md)                                 | Partners can add one additional alarm sound to the phone for use in the Alarm & Clocks app. Partners can also set a new default alarm.                             |
| [Additional notification sounds](additional-notification-sounds.md)       | Partners can add up to three new notification sounds and a reminder sound. In addition, you can also specify a default notification sound for messaging, voicemails, and reminders.    |
| [Additional ringtones](additional-ringtones.md)                           | OEMs and mobile operators can each preload a set of custom ringtone files on Windows mobile devices, and they can set a default ringtone.                        |
| [Call drop and call waiting sounds](call-drop-and-call-waiting-sounds.md) | OEMs can customize the call drop and call waiting sounds.      |
| [Camera shutter sound](camera-shutter-sound.md)                           | The camera shutter sound that occurs when the user takes a picture or starts filming a video can be turned off by removing the Camera shutter option from the Sounds settings screen.      |
| [Ringtone store application](ringtone-store-application.md)               | Partner apps can be used to sell ringtones to users. The app owner must provide the service for the ringtone catalog and to manage downloads. Users are shown an option to Get more ringtones in the ringtone picker, from which they can automatically launch the ringtone store application.                                      |
