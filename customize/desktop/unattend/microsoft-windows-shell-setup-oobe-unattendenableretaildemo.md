# UnattendEnableRetailDemo


Use `UnattendEnableRetailDemo` to enable retail demo mode on the device. Retail demo mode is a special retail mode that can be activated in retail stores to run a demo on the device. The demo highlights key features of the OS and shows off the device user experience.

When `UnattendEnableRetailDemo` is used in combination with other Unattend settings for language, region, keyboard, and EULA agreement, the device boots directly into retail demo mode with a local user account, which is automatically upgraded to a Microsoft account. For more information about retail demo mode and what you need to do to take full advantage of this integrated feature, see [Retail Demo Mode](../retail-demo-experience.md).

Note: If you intend to resell the device to customers, make sure you don’t reuse your unattend file in your [factory reset unattend file](https://docs.microsoft.com/windows-hardware/manufacture/desktop/how-push-button-reset-features-work), otherwise a device reset will trigger retail demo mode again.
