# Microsoft-Windows-CodeIntegrity

The `Microsoft-Windows-CodeIntegrity` component is new in Windows 10, version 1803. Use the `SKUPolicyRequired` setting to indicate whether a Windows 10 device will run in S mode on next boot.

S mode can be applied to a Windows 10 Home, Pro, Pro EDU, or Pro WS edition to enable a productive user experience that's streamlined for security. Windows 10 in S mode supports using apps from the Microsoft Store only, and supports web browsing only in the Microsoft Edge browser. In previous versions of Windows, Windows 10 S was a separate edition that required working with a different Windows image than non-S editions. Starting with Windows 10, version 1803, you can enable S mode on supported Windows editions.

For more on Windows 10 in S mode, including the specifics of which apps and programs are supported, manufacturing and design considerations, and instructions for applying the Unattend file to the image using DISM, see the [Windows 10 in S mode manufacturing overview](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/windows-hardware/manufacture/desktop/windows-10-s-overview).
