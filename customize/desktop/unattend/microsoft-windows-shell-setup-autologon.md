# AutoLogon

`AutoLogon` specifies the account to use to log on to a computer automatically. `AutoLogon` credentials are deleted from the unattended installation answer file after Windows Setup is complete.

> [!Important]
> In Windows 10, if you configure `AutoLogon`, the OS will skip the user account creation phase during OOBE. This is a change from previous versions of Windows.
> In addition, the account creation phase during OOBE is skipped in all versions of Windows when at least one user account is created through the `UserAccounts` section of the same unattend file. This change only applies when no user account is created by unattend such as when setting `AutoLogon` for a built-in or existing account like Administrator or Guest. In these scenarios, Microsoft recommends using unattend to create at least one user account in the Administrators group to ensure that the device can be managed after the autologon is complete.
> Make sure `AutoLogon` is disabled on computers that are delivered to customers.

For more information about the built-in administrator account, see the [How to Enable and Disable the Built-in Administrator Account](http://go.microsoft.com/fwlink/?LinkId=206616) topic in the Windows Assessment and Deployment Kit (Windows ADK) Technical Reference.
