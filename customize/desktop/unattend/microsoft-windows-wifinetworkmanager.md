# Microsoft-Windows-WiFiNetworkManager

> [!Important]
> **This setting has been deprecated**. The information about this deprecated setting is provided for reference only. The Wi-Fi Sense credential sharing feature has been removed.

Specifies settings that you can configure for the Wi-Fi Sense feature.

Wi-Fi Sense automatically connects you to Wi-Fi so you can get online quickly in more places. It can connect you to open Wi-Fi hotspots that it knows about through crowdsourcing, or to Wi-Fi networks that your contacts have shared with you by using Wi-Fi Sense.

Wi-Fi Sense can discover your device location even when location is turned off for your user account. This is true whenever Wi-Fi Sense is turned on. Wi-Fi Sense uses your location to find suggested open Wi-Fi hotspots.
