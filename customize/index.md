# Customize

## Purpose

Customizations of the Windows OS are ways in which partners can modify the Windows device UI, connectivity settings, and user experience to better reflect the partners' brand, and to fit the network and market in which the device ships. Customization options include adding applications, modifying icons and Start layouts, configuring network settings by using device management, changing defaults in **Settings**, and adding brand-specific art and sounds to the OS.

Windows 10 supports both pre-existing desktop Unattend settings, and mobile Managed Centralized Settings Framework (MCSF), for configuring customization options for Windows 10 devices.

See the following sections for more information about what you can do to customize your Windows 10 devices.
