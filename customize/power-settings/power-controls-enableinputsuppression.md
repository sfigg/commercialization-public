# EnableInputSuppression

Use to enable input suppression on a Modern Standby system with a clamshell form factor when the lid is closed, there is no external monitor connected, and the system is on DC power.

When the conditions above are met, it is expected that the system will stay in a low power state to preserve battery life. However, some input devices can wake the system from standby even if the user is not using them. For example, a Bluetooth mouse paired with the system may be stored inside a laptop bag with the system, and the motion of the mouse causes the system to wake. Enabling input suppression prevents this behavior.

## Aliases and setting visibility
