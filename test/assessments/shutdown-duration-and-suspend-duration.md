# Shutdown Duration & Suspend Duration

**Relevant Assessments:**

-   Boot Performance (Fast Startup)
-   Boot Performance (Full Boot)
-   Standby Performance
-   Hibernate Performance

This metric measures the time that the computer spends in shut-down or suspend operations. 

**Detailed Sub-metrics**

When the metric is expanded, a list of shutdown or suspend sub-phases is presented.

> [!NOTE]
> The durations of the sub-phases do not necessarily add up to the overall duration.

**Typical Influencing Factors**

This metric is an overall metric for the system shutdown/suspend. It can be affected by any software components that are running on the shutdown/suspend path.

**Analysis and Remediation Steps**

Expand this metric to see the sub-metrics, which provide more information on individual sub-phases of shutdown/suspend. Examine individual sub-phase metrics and issues to find potential delay contributors.
