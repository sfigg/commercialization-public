# HMD Exerciser Kit Software

The HMD Exerciser Kit includes the following tools:

| **Tool**                          | **Description**                   |
-----------------------------------|-----------------------------------
| ConnExUtil.exe                    | Command line tool for exercising HMD Exerciser features
| HmdKit.cs                         | C\# class that can be used to talk to the HMD Exerciser  from PowerShell or managed test applications 

## ConnExUtil.exe

ConnExUtil.exe is the command line tool for the HMD Exerciser. The tool is installed as part of the MUTT Software Package. Download it [here](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/windows-hardware/drivers/usbcon/mutt-software-package)

Supported command line options are described in the following table.

## HmdKit.cs

Download the HmdKit.cs code from https://github.com/Microsoft/busiotools/tree/master/hmdvalidationkit

### Usage

- Include HmdKit.cs in your automation app.
- Create an instance of the HmdKit class and call findHmdKitDevice to scan COM ports for HmdKits. 
- Check the return value of findHmdKitDevice or the IsPresent property.
- Use the methods to perform actions like connecting USB/HDMI or checking display brightness. 
- If a method returns false, the device may be in a bad state or the COM port may be in use by another application.
    
### Classes
```public class HmdKit : IDisposable``` <br>
This class provides managed access to the functionality of the HMD Validation Kit.

### Private Members
```private const int HmdKitBaudRate = 9600;```<br>The default baud rate for the HMD Kit's Serial over USB communication is 9600 baud.

```private const int RetryCount = 3;```<br>
This constant controls the number of retries for sending a command.
       
```private const string HmdKitVersion = "01";```<br>
 This is the string hardcoded in the HMD Validation Kit for the version. This constant should match the expected version from the HMD Validation Kit.

```private const string HmdKitShieldType = "08";```<br>
This specifies the type of shield detected by the HMD Validation Kit. The current revision should always detect shield type "8".

```private const int ResponseTimeDefault = 500;```<br>
 This is the default response time that should provide enough time for a simple command to complete. Use this for commands that don't involve waiting for something to happen on the HMD Validation Kit like taking audio samples or waiting for sensor data.

```private const int ResponseTimeColorSensor = 2000;```<br>
 This time should provide enough window for the TCS color sensor's "integration time" to elapse and for the HMD Validation Kit to return a value. See the TCS34725 documentation for more information.

```private int responseTimeGetVolume = 1000;```<br>
This is a non-constant value that should provide enough time for a "GetVolume*" command to run for the specified number of samples. It will change every time the SetVolumeSampleCount method is used.

```private SerialPort serialPort;```<br>
 This is the internal instance of the serial port attached to the HMD Validation Kit.

```private Dictionary<string, string> hmdKitCommand = new Dictionary<string, string>();```<br>
This dictionary translates the friendly names of the commands to their real command strings that will be sent over the cable to the HMD Validation Kit.

```private object hmdKitLock = new object();```<br>
This lock is set when the HMD Validation Kit's serial port is being accessed.

```private bool isPresent;```<br>
This private member tracks the enumeration state of the HMD Validation Kit.

### Constructors:
```public HmdKit()```<br>
Initializes a new instance of the HmdKit class. This maps all of the appropriate friendly names to their serial commands along with initializing the enumeration state to false.

### Properties:

```public bool IsPresent```<br>
Gets a value indicating whether the HMD Validation Kit is enumerated.

### Methods:

```public void Dispose()```<br>

```public string GetHdmiPort()```<br>Gets the index of the currently connected HDMI port from the HMD Exerciser. Returns the currently connected HDMI port. '0' means no port is connected. Otherwise, the port will be 2(J2) or 1(J3)

```public void SetServoAngle(string servo, string degrees)```<br>
Sets the angle of the specified servo in degrees. 
- ```servo``` - The servo to set the angle on. See the silkscreen on the servo connectors of the HMD Exerciser.
    - 1 Selects "Servo 1"

```public void SetPresence(bool userPresent)```<br>
Sets the presence spoofing LED to either drown out the HMD's presence sensor with light (no user presence) or spoof user presence. 
- ```userPresent``` - The desired user presence state
    - ```true``` - User presence is spoofed by imitating the IR presence sensor response pattern.
