# Download Supplemental HLK Resources

In addition to installing the Windows Hardware Lab Kit, you may also want to download and use playlists or filters. Certain tests also require downloading supplemental content.

## Windows Hardware Compatibility playlist

Get the official Windows Hardware Compatibility playlist so you can run the Windows HLK tests that ensure your hardware meets the requirements for compatibility with Windows 10. 
- [Download the Windows Hardware Compatibility playlist](http://aka.ms/HLKPlaylist)

## Windows HLK filters 

When there is a problem in either a Windows HLK test or in the operating system itself that causes certification tests to fail incorrectly, we create an errata that allows partners to bypass the problematic test. Most errata use filters to automatically filter the failure from the submission results. Filters are applied within Windows HLK Studio.
