# Step 2: Setup an HLK Proxy System


>[!NOTE]  
> Make sure that the credentials of the user on the proxy system match those of an administrator on your HLK controller:
>-   Local administrator account on proxy: &lt;ProxyMachineName&gt;\\TestAdmin
>-   Local administrator account on controller: &lt;HLKControllerMachineName&gt;\\TestAdmin
>-   Both with the same password

 

1.  On the Proxy system (which may be the same machine as the HLK Controller), run setup.exe from the following location: 

    `\\<ControllerName>\HLKInstall\ProxyClient\setup.exe`

    >[!NOTE]
    >  Replace &lt;ControllerName&gt; with the name of the test controller.

2.  The WTT Proxy Setup wizard appears. Follow the instructions in the setup wizard to completion.

1.  Start the Proxy Service by double clicking on the **WTT Proxy** shortcut on the desktop of the proxy system or by navigating to  %ProgramFiles(X86)%\\WTTMobile\\Client\\ and running the following command from the elevated command prompt:  

    `WTTProxy.exe -console`

4.  Leave the elevated command prompt window from the previous step open.
