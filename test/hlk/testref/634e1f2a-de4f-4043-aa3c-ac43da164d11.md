# System Audio - Verify Audio EffectsDiscovery (Manual) - Desktop

>[!IMPORTANT]
>  
This test requires supplemental content. You can find this content in the 'Windows HLK supplemental test content' section at the following location:

-   <http://go.microsoft.com/fwlink/p/?LinkId=532718>

 

-   Test1/Test2

    Use WinRT APIs to check for the existence of raw mode support on a capture or render audio device. To support raw mode, the driver must support the new DDI for audio signal processing modes.

-   Test3/Test4

    Check for effects that are turned on by default in capture or render device on raw or default streams. On raw streams, the only expected effects are endpoint mode effects such as speaker compensation or speaker protection. On render stream of the **Communication** category, no effects are expected other than endpoint effects. The presence of effects in the **Other** category can also fail the test.

-   Test 5/Test 6

    In this test, all effects are disabled and then raw and default streams are queried to ensure that no effects other than must-have effects are on in the pipeline. Must-have effects include endpoint effects that cannot or should not be turned off.

-   Manual tests:

    This test ensures that when each of the effects on the UI (Microsoft Store App UI, or Enhancements tab in Sound Control panel) is enabled, the effects list shows up correctly.

    If you are implementing effects for a modern system with the Microsoft Store App UI (Hardware Support App), you must expose its UI to the user to enable/disable audio effects. Ensure that UI is functioning correctly for each applicable device. 

    If you are implementing a legacy system with enhancements reported in the Sound Control panel, the test will iterate through each render/capture device and show the initial list of default effects on raw and default streams. It then prompts you to enable the effects on the UI. You can enable the effects one at a time or all at once. You should pay attention to the list of effects displayed as they choose each option. This should be repeated for each device. After the tests are done, you should press **Enter** to proceed. You are asked if the list of effects displayed is accurate. You can select **Y** or **N** as answer.
