# Manual Test - SOC Drivers Hal Extensions and Subsystem image loading

This is a manual test & it should be run outside HLK by following the manual instructions provided below.
                                            If this test is run as an automated test from HLK studio/controller, the test will pass by default without testing any functionality.
                                            ---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
                                            Manual instructions to run this test:
                                            I.	Hardware Prerequisites
                                                1.	Device under test
                                            II.	Software Prerequisites
                                                1.	List of devnodes that failed from previous test pass
                                            III.	Setting up the Test
                                                1.	On device under test, flash firmware & install full OS
                                            IV.	Running the Test
                                                1.	Power up the device with a KD session
                                                2.	Break into the debugger manually
                                                3.	Run !pnptriage and note the "Dumping dev-nodes with problems"
                                            V.	Verification
                                                1.	First eliminate all devnodes that failed with error 0xc0000490 (CM_PROB_FAILED_INSTALL). These should NOT be considered
                                                2.	Look at all other devnodes that failed
                                                3.	Test fails if 
                                                    a)	Devnode was not seen in previous BSP 
                                                    b)	Devnode not failure cannot be justified and/or is unknown
                                                4.	Record list of devnodes that failed for next/subsequent test pass
                                            ---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
                                            Note: This test is associated with an optional feature: System.Client.ARM64DesktopHardware. It will not appear in the list of tests in HLK studio for a system target by default.
                                            Optional: To enable it to show up in the list of tests for system target in HLK studio, run the following steps:
                                            1] In HLK Studio, select system target
                                            2] Right click on the selected system target
                                            3] Click on Add\Modify Features
                                            4] A Device Feature List window will open up
                                            5] Scroll down to select the feature named: System.Client.MobileHardware 
                                            6] Click on the check box to enable this optional feature
                                            7] This test will now appear in the list of applicable tests for the selected system target in HLK studio
