Before you run the test, complete the test setup as described in the test requirements: [Mouse or other Pointing Device Testing Prerequisites](mouse-or-other-pointing-device-testing-prerequisites.md).

The test presents five iterations during which you are prompted to touch a contact to the touchpad in a specified region. At the prompt, you should tap a total of five times per region at random unique points inside that region.

In each case, the test validates that a tap occurs in the specified region. If a tap is detected, the test automaticallyes pass the iteration. If no tap is detected after any physical tap in the specified region, you should manually fail the iteration.
