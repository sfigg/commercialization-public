# Modern Standby Wake on Voice Basic Test on DC-power Source

Wake on Voice (Keyword) Basic Test implements two test cases:  - one test case exercises the DC-power source - the other test case exercises the AC-power source. Software-simulated battery is used to change power sources. The test causes the system to enter and exit Modern Standby. Some system measurements are also taken to validation during the tests such as Modern Standby support, Software and Hardware DRIPS (Deepest Runtime Idle Power State), lower Divergence Delta between the Software DRIPS and the hardware DRIPS, Hardware Keyword spotting support, reasonable Modern Standby Exit Latency.  NOTE: On Modern Standby system where the storage device containing the boot volume is not backed by a physical disk of Solid State Disk (SSD) media type or Storage Class Memory (SCM) media type, the Modern Standby Exit Latency is reported but the constraints on the measured latency value will not be enforced by this Modern Standby Basic Requirement Test.In the case where the storage device/solution reports a seek penalty or a rotational delay (thus indicating rotating media), the Modern Standby system will operate in a default Disconnected Mode.
