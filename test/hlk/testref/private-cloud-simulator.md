# Private Cloud Simulator for Windows Server 2019

## <span id="Introduction"></span><span id="introduction"></span><span id="INTRODUCTION"></span>Introduction

The current industry trend is for private cloud solutions to comprise tightly integrated software and hardware components in order to deliver a resilient private cloud with high performance. Issues in any of the components (software, hardware, drivers, firmware, and so forth) can compromise the solution and undermine the promises made regarding a Service Level Agreement (SLA) for the private cloud.

Some of these issues are surfaced only under a high-stress, cloud-scale deployment, and are potentially hard to find using traditional standalone, component-focused tests. The Private Cloud Simulator is a cloud validation test suite that enables you to validate your component in a cloud scenario and identify these types of issues.

### Target Audience

The target audience for this document are those working towards validating their hardware for Windows Server Logo, Microsoft Azure Stack (MAS) solutions and Windows Server Software Defined (WSSD) datacenter offerings (that offer SDDC Standard, SDDC Premium Additional Qualifiers on the Windows Server Catalog).

## <span id="Test_Overview"></span><span id="test_overview"></span><span id="TEST_OVERVIEW"></span>Test Overview

Private Cloud Simulator (PCS) simulates a live datacenter/private cloud by creating VM workloads, simulating data center operations (load balancing, software/hardware maintenance), and injecting compute/storage faults (unplanned hardware/software failure). PCS uses a Microsoft SQL Server database to record test and solution data during the run. It then presents a report that includes operation pass/fail rates and logs whihch provide the capability to correlate data for pass/fail determination and failure diagnosis (as applicable).

### Topology

PCS lab environment contains the following elements:

* An Active Directory domain controller/DNS/DHCP server for the test domain.
  * You can find information about Active Directory at <https://msdn.microsoft.com/library/bb727067.aspx>
  * [Active Directory Domain Services Functional Levels](https://technet.microsoft.com/en-us/library/understanding-active-directory-functional-levels.aspx) needs to be Windows Server 2012 or higher.
* A dedicated HLK controller machine. OS must be Windows Server 2016.
* A dedicated PCS controller machine. OS must be Windows Server 2019.
* A compute cluster, which hosts Hyper-V virtual machines. The minimun number of nodes depends on the type of [PCS jobs](#pcs_tests).

Supporting Documents:

* [Windows Server 2016 Storage Spaces Direct cluster](https://technet.microsoft.com/en-us/library/mt693395.aspx)
* [Failover-Clustering](https://technet.microsoft.com/en-us/library/hh831579.aspx)
* [Microsoft Azure Stack Logo Requirements](http://aka.ms/getreq) released via Microsoft Collaborate to Microsoft partners

Notes:

* All the above machines must be joined to the same test domain.
* All PCS tests need to be run as the same user in the 'Domain Admins' group for the test domain.
* Use the same user with Domain Admin credentials to install the HLK controller.

* Install the HLK Client using the [Windows HLK Getting Started guide](https://msdn.microsoft.com/library/windows/hardware/dn915002) and open the requisite ports.
* Install .NET Framework 3.5 (This feature is not included by default in Windows Server 2019).
  * Generic Installation Instructions can be found at the following locations:
    * <https://msdn.microsoft.com/library/hh506443>
    * <https://msdn.microsoft.com/library/windows/desktop/hh848079>
  * For builds released via Microsoft Connect, see details below:
    * Mount the ISO supplied with the build and find the file at **MountedDriveLetter:\\sources\\sxs\\microsoft-windows-netfx3-ondemand-package.cab**
    * Copy the file to a local folder on the PCS controller
    * Install the package by executing this command line using admin privileges

      ```powershell
      Add-WindowsFeature Net-Framework-Features -source <Local Folder>
      ```

## <span id="PCS_Tests"></span><span id="pcs_tests"></span><span id="PCS_TESTS"></span>PCS Tests

PCS jobs are summarized below:

* PrivateCloudSimulator - Device.Network.LAN.10GbOrGreater  
This test contains a set of actions, that specifically target the network adapter device along with VM and compute cluster actions.
* PrivateCloudSimulator - Device.Network.LAN.AzureStack  
This test contains an extended set of actions, that verify network adapter support for the new 'Software Defined Networking' feature in Windows Server, along with VM and compute cluster actions.
* PrivateCloudSimulator - System.Solutions.StorageSpacesDirect (MIN)/(MAX)  
This test contains an extended set of actions, that target the entire solution built on an hyper-converged storage spaces direct cluster. The (MIN) test should be run on a cluster with the minimum number of supported nodes for the solution. The (MAX) test should be run on a cluster with the maximum number of supported nodes for the solution.
* PrivateCloudSimulator - System.Solutions.AzureStack (MIN)/(MAX)  
This test contains an extended set of actions, that target the entire AzureStack solution. The (MIN) test should be run on a cluster with the minimum number of supported nodes for the solution. The (MAX) test should be run on a cluster with the maximum number of supported nodes for the solution.

### PCS Job Execution Flow

Each PCS job contains the following tasks.

* Initialize PCS Controller
  * In this stage, the PCS execution engine sets up a SQL server and IIS on the PCS controller machine
  * It also copies content (e.g. evaluation OS VHD files) to enable VM creation in the next stage
* Create VMs
    * This stage sees the PCS engine start creating VMs on each node of the cluster
    * VM creation stops when the target number of VMs/node has been reached.
    * This step is a part of PCS setup phase. Test run duration timer kicks in post this stage.
* Run PCS Actions
    * Now, PCS initiates various types of actions (VM, Cluster, Storage, Network) on each node of the cluster.
    * Actions run in parallel and co-ordinate among themselves to exercise the device (storage, network) and the solution through the private cloud/datacenter lifecycle
    * Actions run periodically and stop once the target execution time (defined by the profile/job) of the test has been reached.
    * Test execution time is defined per profile and can vary based on the profile you are running. Test execution timer kicks in after all the VMs are created.
    * The steps in each action and the corresponding result of each step is stored in the SQL server.
* Cleanup Run
    * In this stage, VMs created in stage (4) are cleaned up and the cluster is restored to a clean state (as possible).
    * It generates a report file (PcsReport.htm) and a ZIP file that contains test logs.
* Report result in HLK Studio
    * In this stage, the HLK studio reports the result of the PCS run.
    * The result can be packaged into an HLKX file for submission to Microsoft.

#### Cleanup

Use the **C:\\Pcs\\ReRunPcsCleanup.cmd** script on the PCS-Controller for cleaning up state of the setup if the test abruptly ends. It is very important that stale VMs & SDN infrastructure is cleaned up before starting a new run.

Please make sure the following items are cleaned up before starting a new run:

* Clustered VM roles (FailoverClusterManager-&gt;Cluster-&gt;Roles)

  ```powershell
  Get-ClusterGroup -Cluster $clusterName
  ```

* All the VMs created by PCS

  ```powershell
  Get-ClusterNode -Cluster $clusterName | % { Get-VM -ComputerName $_.Name }
  ```

* vNics created by PCS/SDN

  ```powershell
  Get-ClusterNode -Cluster $clusterName | % { Get-VMNetworkAdapter -ComputerName $_.Name -ManagementOS | Select-Object ComputerName,Name,SwitchName }
  ```

  ![powershell showing vnic that needs to be cleaned up](images/pcs-lan-azurestack-vnic-cleanup.png)

* Storage/CSV-volumes on the cluster do not have any entries pertaining to PCS (C:\\ClusterStorage\\Volume1\\PCS)

#### Duration

* PCS actions (listed below) run for about 24 hours.
* The complete run may take an additional 36-48 hours (including time for setup and cleanup).

## <span id="realtime"></span><span id="REALTIME"></span>View PCS report in real-time through SQL Server Reporting Services

While PCS operations are running, reports are saved in a SQL database on the PCS Controller. Each report lists all operations that were performed, their pass percentages, and all resources that were acquired and released during the test. A new database is created for each test run to enable you to review data from previous test runs at any time.

To view the report, follow these steps:

* By default, Internet Explorer Enhanced Security Configuration is enabled on Windows Server. You need to disable it to view the report.

    Open Server Manager =&gt; Local Server =&gt; Click **IE Enhanced Security Configuration** to turn it off for administrators and users.

* Open IE from PCS controller and visit http://PcsControllerMachineName/Reports

  ![pcs reporting page in internet explorer](images/pcs-ie-reports-page.png)

* Click **PCS Reports** =&gt; **PCSRuns**.
* Each PCS run is identified by a unique **Pass Run ID**.

  ![ie reporting showing pass run ids](images/pcs-ie-reports-pass-run-id.png)

* Click a **Pass Run ID** (for example, click f44b3f88-3dbf-476e-9294-9d479ca0a369) to open a report from the PCS run. The data in these reports is live. While a test runs, you can monitor the progress of a test run in real-time.
  * An overview of all resources (nodes, cluster, and VMs) that participated in the test run.
  * All actions that were performed on each resource. The Pass and Fail columns report the number of actions that passed and failed.

  ![ie reporting showing run information](images/pcs-ie-reports-run-information.png)

* In the **Overall Operation Information** table, you can click links in the **Action**/**Pass**/**Fail** column to open detail pages, which give you more information about the action's results. For example, if you clicked the failure number 9 by the **VMLiveMigrationAction** entry, you would see the summary shown in the following illustration.

  ![ie reporting showing vmlivemigrationaction](images/pcs-ie-reports-vmlivemigrationaction.png)

* The first entry above provides the following information:

  * **Failure ID:** When we encounter a failure in PCS, we generalize the Failure Message and generate a unique Hash for it. In above example the Failure ID is **97c12afd-23a8-3982-e304-a5dc6793950d**
  * **Failure Hash:** Generalized failure message. In the example above, the failure hash is

    Virtual Machine &lt;VIRTUAL MACHINE&gt; live migration failed at progress &lt;PERCENTAGE&gt; (migration state: Migrating)  
    Error: Virtual machine migration operation for '&lt;VIRTUAL MACHINE&gt;' failed at migration destination '&lt;COMPUTE NODE&gt;'. (Virtual machine ID &lt;GUID&gt;)  
    Failed to receive data for a Virtual Machine migration: This operation returned because the timeout period expired. (0x800705B4).

  * **Count Current Run:** The count of actions of a particular type that failed with this particular error message during this run. In the above example, **VMLiveMigrationAction** was run 3 times.
  * **Count All Runs:** A count of actions that failed because of this particular failure across all PCS runs. For the **VMLiveMigrationAction**, this count was 3.
  * **PCS Runs Affected:** Tells how many runs have been affected by this failure. For **VMLiveMigrationAction**, only 1 PCS run was affected.

* To look further into the error - you can click a failure ID on that screen to drill down to a global history of the failure type across all PCS runs. For example, click **97c12afd-23a8-3982-e304-a5dc6793950d** to display the following. The page lists all failed operations, grouped by failure type, which has the effect of highlighting key features that you might need to investigate.

  ![ie reporting showing failing actions by cause](images/pcs-ie-reports-failing-actions.png)

* If you click the Action ID, you can drill down farther to see an Action Log Report. Errors are shown in red; Warnings are shown in yellow.

  ![ie reporting showing action log report](images/pcs-ie-reports-action-log.png)

There are multiple stages in PCS Execution Flow. Below is an example when viewing a result from HLK Manager =&gt; Explorers =&gt; Job Monitor =&gt; select Machine Pool =&gt; select the job in Job Execution Status.

![pcs controller showing task execution status](images/pcs-task-execution-status.png)

If PCS failed at **Setup**, **Execute**, or **Cleanup** stage, you can browse job logs by right click the job name (or a child task name) =&gt; click Browse Job Logs. The log file names are PCS-E2Elaunch\_Setup.log, PCSE2Elaunch\_Execute.log, and PCS-E2Elaunch\_Cleanup.log. Log files should contain information about failures. Try to search for unexpected exception near the end of log files.

## <span id="Troubleshoot_a_PCS_run_from_the_PCS_Controller"></span><span id="troubleshoot_a_pcs_run_from_the_pcs_controller"></span><span id="TROUBLESHOOT_A_PCS_RUN_FROM_THE_PCS_CONTROLLER"></span>Troubleshoot a PCS run from the PCS Controller

When a PCS job fails at Setup/Execute/Cleanup stage, you can rerun the stage directly from PCS controller. This method is useful to for troubleshooting problems in these stages.

* Open elevated command prompt
* ReRun **ReRunPcsSetup.cmd**, **ReRunPcsExecute.cmd**, or **ReRunPcsCleanup.cmd** script

## <span id="Logs_and_Diagnose"></span><span id="logs_and_diagnose"></span><span id="LOGS_AND_DIAGNOSE"></span>Logs and Diagnose

PCS has three main stages: Setup, Execute, and Cleanup. A PCS job uses PCS-E2Elaunch.ps1 script to launch these three stages. Their log file names are called PCS-E2ELaunch\_Setup.log, PCS-E2ELaunch\_Execute.log and PCSE2ELaunch\_Cleanup.log.

When a PCS run has completed, PCS analyzes logs during **Cleanup** stage. A run succeeded when the following criteria are met, with the analyzed report saved as PCSReport.htm.

* All PCS actions has at least 90% pass rate
* No unexpected crash of any cluster node, except the ones initiated by PCS for testing purpose

The following files are generated on PCS Controller during **Cleanup** stage.

* PcsReport.htm: summary about the run.
* ClusterName-PRE.mht.html: cluster validation test report that is run before **Execute** stage
* ClusterName-POST.mht.html: cluster validation test report that is run after **Execute** stage
* PcsLog-DateTime.zip: contains logs and is copied to the HLK Controller when test finished.
  * MHTML folder: contains PCS SQL logs
  * SDDCDiagnosticInfo folder: contains cluster logs and event logs

The issues seen or resulting from a PCS certification run has been observed to not be related to PCS itself many times. Below contains a basic guide to help narrow down some of the issues.

* Run cluster validation test and check report for errors.
* On the failover cluster manager, check whether all the nodes, vDisk, and Pool are in healthy condition. If they are not, it is fine to invest time on checking the logs/debugging before calling upon MSFT.
* Open Hyper-V manager and make sure the VMs and vSwitches get enumerated (also possible by running Get-VM or Get-VMSwitch).
* Make sure you are able create a vSwitch outside of PCS tests on one/all of the compute nodes.
* Make sure you can create a VM on one/all of the nodes and can attach a vmNetworkAdapter it to a vSwitch.
* Look for dump files generated due to bugchecks by running "dir /s \*.dmp" from the %systemdrive% on the compute nodes.
* Possible usage of [LiveKD](https://technet.microsoft.com/en-us/sysinternals/livekd.aspx) to look at kernel modules/threads that are stuck, if you do not have kernel debugger attached.
* Check if compute nodes' license is active, as Eval version license get reset every 180 days.

### Generate a ZIP file that contains PCS logs

You can run the following script from PCS controller to generate a ZIP file that contains required logs. This method is useful when job is cacelled or while test is running.

```powershell
C:\pcs\PCS-E2ELaunch.ps1 -DomainName <string> -UserName <string> -Password <string> -ComputeCluster <string> [-StorageCluster <string>] -CollectLog [-CollectLogLevel <int>]
```

**Parameters**

* DomainName: Test user's fully qualified domain name (FQDN).
* UserName: Test user's user name
* Password: Test user's password
* ComputeCluster: Name of compute cluster name
* StorageCluster: optional, Name of storage cluster name. Don't specify this parameter if Computer and Storage clusters are the same.
* CollectLog: Required
* CollectLogLevel: optional, default is 1. Enter 3 to collect verbose logs.

### Generate PcsReport.htm file manually

While PCS is running, you can run the following cmdlets on PCS controller to generate a HTML report that lists unexpected bugchecks from all nodes.

```powershell
Import-Module C:\PCS\PrivateCloudSimulator-Manager.psm1
Get-PCSReport
```

### Enable or Disable a PCS action
Each PCS job has its own xml files that define its actions. These XML files can be found on HLK Controller. Below is an example for **PrivateCloudSimulator - System.Solution.AzureStack** job

C:\\Program Files (x86)\\Windows Kits\\10\\Hardware Lab Kit\\Tests\\amd64\\PCS\\**System.Solutions.AzureStack**\\PrivateCloudSimulator\_Create.xml

```xml
<ConfigurableType Type="Microsoft.PrivateCloudSimulator.VM.Actions.HyperV.VmCloneAction, Microsoft.PrivateCloudSimulator.VM.Actions.HyperV">
  <ConfigurableTypeField FieldName="Interval" ValueType="System.TimeSpan" Value="00:01:00" />
  <ConfigurableTypeField FieldName="StartupNumber" ValueType="System.Int32" Value="2" />
  <ConfigurableTypeField FieldName="InjectVMRTInGuest" ValueType="System.Boolean" Value="true" />
  <ConfigurableTypeField FieldName="BaseVHDPath" ValueType="System.String" Value="%BASEVHD%" />
</ConfigurableType>
```

* Test Action name is VmCloneAction.
* The **Interval** field sets the frequency with which the action runs. Use the format *hh:mm:ss*. For example, the value 02:00:00 repeats the action every 2 hours.
* The **StartUpNumber** field defines the number of instances of that action to initiate on each node of the compute cluster. To disable an action, set this field to zero.
* Don't modify other fields.
* Each job could contain up to 3 xml files: PrivateCloudSimulator.xml, PrivateCloudSimulator\_Create.xml, PrivateCloudSimulator\_Storage.xml

```xml
<ConfigurableType Type="Microsoft.PrivateCloudSimulator.VM.Actions.HyperV.VmCloneBase, Microsoft.PrivateCloudSimulator.VM.Actions.HyperV">
  <ConfigurableTypeField FieldName="VmClusteringPercentage" ValueType="System.Int32" Value="100" />
  <ConfigurableTypeField FieldName="UseDiffDisks" ValueType="System.Boolean" Value="false" />
</ConfigurableType>
```

* PCS by default uses the provided guest OS VHD to create VMs that have fixed disks by default. To create VMs that have differencing disks instead, set the **UseDiffDisks** value to **true**.

### Customize Action Logs

A PCS run has a RunId. A PCS action has an action ID. When a PCS action fails, PCS removes the variant (i.e. VM name) from the failure message and generates a unique hash value for it. Similar failures have same unique hash value. PCS then groups them together in SQL report site.

PCS uses .NET Trace Listeners to collect test results. These listeners are defined in Microsoft.PrivateCloudSimulator.exe.config.

* SQLOnline: This listener logs the results into SQL database.
* AnalyticalLogGather: This listener collects extra information when an action is failed.

When a particular action fails or a particular hash value is seen, you can configure AnalyticalLogGather listener to collect event logs, cluster logs, or call a script. This is defined in ActionFailureReactionPolicy.xml.

In ActionFailureReactionPolicy.xml, PCS supports two types of triggers and three types of reactions. Using this XML, you can define rules like "when trigger X is seen, take reactions Y and Z". Most actions would have NodeScope set to ReservedOnly and MaxLevel set to 3 (Critical, Error, and Warning events).

**Trigger:**

| Type         | Data           |
|--------------|----------------|
| ActionFail   | ActionFullName |
| KnownFailure | FailureHash    |

**Reaction:**

| Type                 | Data                                                                 |
|----------------------|----------------------------------------------------------------------|
| ETWCollection        | Channel, NodeScope, StorageLocation, MaxLevel                        |
| ClusterLogCollection | UseLocalTime, NodeScope, StorageLocation, MaxTimeDuration (optional) |
| CustomPS             | ScriptFullPath, NodeScope, Argument                                  |

Valid NodeScope values are the following:

* AllNodes
* ComputeOnly
* StorageOnly
* EdgeOnly
* NCOnly
* ReservedOnly

Valid MaxLevel values are the following:

* 0 (logs at all levels)
* 1 (Critical)
* 2 (Error)
* 3 (Warning)
* 4 (Information)
* 5 (Verbose)

**Examples:**

```xml
<Trigger>
  <Type>ActionFail</Type>
  <Data Name="ActionFullName" Value="Microsoft.HyperV.Test.Stress.PrivateCloud.ComputeNode.Action.StorageNodeRestartAction">
  </Data>
  <ReactionMatchList>
    <!-- Details of Reaction are Defined Below and are referenced using the ID attribute-->
    <MatchingReaction ID ="1"></MatchingReaction>
    <MatchingReaction ID ="2"></MatchingReaction>
  </ReactionMatchList>
</Trigger>49
<Reaction ID="1">
  <Type>ETWCollection</Type>
  <Data Name="Channel" Value="Microsoft-Windows-Hyper-V-VMMS-Analytic"></Data>
  <Data Name="NodeScope" Value="ReservedOnly"></Data>
  <Data Name="StorageLocation" Value="C:\PCS\PCSEventData\%NODE%\%ActionId%\EventLogs"></Data>
  <Data Name="MaxLevel" Value="3"></Data>

Action log files are saved to 'FORENSICLOGLOCATION' folder on PCS controller. By default, it is C:\\PCS\\PCSEventData.

For each failed action, the following information is collected from the reserved node(s). This log location can be seen in the action's SQL report page.

* %MachineName%\\%RunId%\\ClusterLogs\\%ActionId%
* %MachineName%\\%RunId%\\EventLogs\\%ActionId%
* %MachineName%\\%RunId%\\CustomResponse\\%ActionId%

### Do we need to install the HLK Client on cluster nodes?

You need to install HLK Client on cluster nodes and on the PCS controller as well.

### Boot disk of cluster node has very little free space due to a large pagefile

By default, Windows automatically manages paging file size and its location. Default location is C:\\pagefile.sys and file size could grow while test runs.

You can specify pagefile location and size by modifying the PagingFiles value. Below is an expample that set the initial and maximum pagefile sizes to 50GB (51200MB).

```syntax
reg add "HKLM\SYSTEM\CurrentControlSet\Control\Session Manager\Memory Management" /v PagingFiles /t REG_MULTI_SZ /d "C:\pagefile.sys 51200 51200" /f
```

### Windows does not save memory dump file after a crash

Make sure you initial pagefile size is greater than 50GB. A dump file wont get created if pagefile size is too small. Please see the link below for more information.

### What is the PCS support alias?

Please send email to [pvsha@microsoft.com](mailto://pvsha@microsoft.com) for any queries related to PCS or WSSD, AzureStack hardware certification.
