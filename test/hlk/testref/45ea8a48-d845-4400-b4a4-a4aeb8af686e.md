Before you run the test, Secure Boot option should be in the default shipping (out-of-box) configuration, specifically:

-   Secure Boot option must be ON.

-   Microsoft Keys are in Key-Exchange key (KEK) and signature database (db).

This test requires that the system is imaged through the OEM manufacturing process (TPM should be cleared before OS is laid down and installed as part of the deployment). This test should only be run on systems that have gone through an OEM-style imaging process.
