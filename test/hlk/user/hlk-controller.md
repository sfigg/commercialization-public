# HLK Controller

A test server has two parts: Windows HLK Controller and [Windows HLK Studio](hlk-studio.md). The Controller software is the engine that manages tests that are run on test systems. It is installed from the Windows HLK installation source. After installation, the test server contains separate installers to install a remote Windows HLK Studio and Windows HLK Client. 

One controller governs a collection of client computers. Controllers can manage and access only the client computers that they govern.
